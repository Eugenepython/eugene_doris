            <h1>Civil and Commercial Costs Lawyers - Costs Draftsman</h1>
            <p>August 2012 - October 2016</p>
            <p>I worked as part of a costs firm providing legal services to dozens of UK firms handling particular firms by myself. As a fee earner I prepared Bills of Costs, Points of Dispute and advices to clients on civil costs settlements. I progressed through the company and began to appear as an advocate at some hearings and worked on the costs of complex legal cases including personal injury, judicial reviews and contractual disputes.</p>
